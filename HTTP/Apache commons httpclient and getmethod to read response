It is vital that the response body is always read regardless of the status returned by the server.
There are three ways to do this:

Call method.getResponseBody()
This will return a byte array containing the data in the response body.

Call method.getResponseBodyAsString(). 
This will return a String containing the response body. 
Be warned though that the conversion from bytes to a String is done using the default encoding so this method may not be portable across all platforms.

Call method.getResponseBodyAsStream() 
and read the entire contents of the stream then call  stream.close(). 
This method is best if it is possible for a lot of data to be received as it can be buffered to a file or 
processed as it is read. Be sure to always read the entirety of the data and call close() on the stream.
